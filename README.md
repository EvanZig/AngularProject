This is a weekly calendar website i made in agular/tailwind as an intern where the user can create/delete tasks or mark them as done for each day. Its fully made in the front end utilizing the local storage. Initially when there are no tasks saved in local storage there is a fallback where some default are created. To save the state of the website click on save.
